# Changelog

All notable changes to QuantRule are documented here. The changelog is grouped
by release and records meaningful user-facing or developer-facing changes. It is
the release history, not the execution tracker: issues, sub-issues, pull
requests, and their status live on the GitHub Project.

The changelog starts at the 2026-11-07 workflow documentation reset. Earlier
release notes are in [`docs/releases/`](docs/releases/), and the detailed change
history is in Git and the pull requests. Historical tags, including
`v0.4.0-exp-baseline` and `audit-closure-2026-10-30`, are retained as markers and
are not treated as releases.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- An optional `session` calendar in `data.json` and session-aware coverage
  fields in the model report. Weekends and declared holidays no longer count as
  missing bars for session-bound instruments; the existing span coverage is
  retained.
- The `vol_regime` and `structure_state` context states. `vol_regime` is the
  persistent 0/1/2 volatility regime; `structure_state` is the confirmed major
  +1/0/-1 swing structure. Both are strategy-readable and leave existing event
  values unchanged.
- `help workflows` in the shell: an intention-to-workflow selection guide with
  the first command or tool for each workflow.
- The workflow lab now shows the command-level selection table and the model
  research/swarm quick path.
- The model-prediction condition gate accepts the published `level_touches`
  reading and integer `min`/`max` bounds, enabling a location-conditioned model
  evaluation without a Rust model change.
- The `MR`/`SR`/`PR` research-family prefix and the `-Cnn` configuration suffix;
  historical `M2.x`–`M4.x` aliases remain in `docs/registry/history.md`.
- Per-cell model configuration in the research runner, with the model config
  hash recorded in provenance.
- Sequence, confluence, freshness, and descriptive path evaluators for model
  research; the MR5 inherited-coverage checker, grid builder, and reference
  grid.
- Event-family sequence conditions (`first_events` / `second_events`), a strict
  ordering gap, and a confirmed-level filter on the confirming bar.
- Per-hypothesis timeframes, a configurable family/run prefix, and synthesized
  run configs for an extra instrument in the research grid builder.
- The MR6 ordered-confirmation grid (15 cells, five primary, reverse-order
  controls) and its `no_edge` development result.
- The `M1.1` opening-range sweep and no-reclaim control events, with the
  `session.sweep_atr` spec field; the registry moves to 145 events and 191
  validation claims.
- `COPPERCMDUSD` and `TSLAUSUSD` as price-only instruments, with aliases
  `COPPER` and `TSLA`; volume, participation, and flow events exclude them.
- The MR7 opening-range sweep grid (15 cells) and its `no_edge` result.
- The research report applies a declared mean-net-R path gate before naming a
  candidate.
- An optional `contrarian` boolean on an event-composite event entry: the
  entry takes the opposite side of the matched event while the event identity
  and evidence stay unchanged. The default is `false`; the parser rejects the
  field on a state condition and on the compression-bracket engine.
- The SR1 compression-breakout fade strategy config, 15-cell development
  matrix, 9 bps sensitivity configs, and per-cell qualification criteria.
- A deterministic strategy feasibility preflight
  (`tools/improvement/feasibility.py`) and its Strategy Research gate: a
  hypothesis whose target is below its round-trip cost, whose breakeven win
  rate exceeds 50% after costs, or whose timeframe exceeds 1 hour is rejected
  before any backtest cell. The SR1 development run stopped early as
  infeasible after 10 of 15 cells; the completed cells all halted, and the 4:1
  payoff failed the preflight.
- The SR2-A BTCUSD robustness audit and its read-only analysis tool: the
  positive BTC lead survives 9 bps and the 5% drawdown run in sign, but is
  concentrated in the top five trades, is not statistically significant, and is
  about 0.1%/month at the 5% ceiling. The audit generates condition hypotheses
  but no candidate.
- The SR2 dual-design fade configs and its 30-cell development run: 1h with a
  1 ATR stop / 3 ATR target and 15m with a 1 ATR stop / 4 ATR target, both on
  BTCUSD/EURUSD/XAUUSD. Both designs returned `no_edge`; the 9 bps sensitivity
  and the 2024 validation were not opened.
- The `rvol_regime` model context state: `-1` below 1.4, `0` from 1.4 to 2.0,
  and `+1` at or above 2.0. It is published in `readings.csv` and `report.json`
  and is readable as a strategy state; no event value changes.
- The SR2-BTC-FEATURES top-trade attribution tool and record: 139 decision-bar
  feature rows, five 1,000-candle charts, and the stack-aligned low-RVOL fade
  hypothesis. The 2019 loss persists in every filter subset.
- The SR3-FEATURES feature-filtered BTCUSD fade programme: eight 2018–2022
  variants, 40 base cells, and 30 9 bps sensitivity cells. The 1h sides are
  positive at 6 and 9 bps but have 9–21 trades per side; the 15m entry is
  negative; H4 long reaches 5.04%. Verdict: no candidate; 2024 not opened.
- The SR4-STACK-FADE multi-instrument programme: three 1h rules × BTCUSD,
  EURUSD, and XAUUSD × two sides × 2018–2022, 90 base cells. The pooled S1 sides
  are positive but BTC-only; EURUSD and XAUUSD are negative on every variant and
  side, and the BTC cells breach 5% drawdown. Verdict: no candidate; 9 bps and
  2024 not opened.
- The SR5 absorption-rejection programme and its count gate: 15m
  `signal.absorption_rejection` with a 1h EMA-stack context on BTCUSD. A1 has 5
  long and 8 short events over 2018–2022, below the 30-per-side gate; the
  event-only control is 15/17. Verdict: underpowered; no backtest, 9 bps, or
  2024 access.
- The SR6-VWAP programme: 15m `signal.vwap_rejection` with a 1h EMA-stack
  context on BTCUSD, 30 base cells. V1 long and short are negative with PF
  0.966/0.853 and every cell breaches 5% drawdown. Verdict: no candidate; 9 bps
  and 2024 not opened.
- The SR7-H3-CRYPTO programme: BTCUSD+ETHUSD H3 1h fade, 20 base cells. H3
  long is +$2,289 with PF 2.098 and 5/5 positive years but 27 trades and 5.62%
  drawdown; H3 short is PF 1.067 with 1/5 years and a negative ETH side.
  Verdict: no candidate; 9 bps and 2024 not opened.
- The SR8-H3-BUFFER programme: one-shot 2023 BTC buffer for the frozen H3 rule.
  2023 1h coverage is 61.3%, below the 95% gate; H3 long has 0 trades and H3
  short 4. Verdict: buffer ineligible; no no-edge conclusion; 2024 not opened.
- The SR8-A-H3-ARCHIVE check: the Dukascopy 2023 archive has 525,600 rows but
  38,948 flat zero-volume placeholders; only 61.4% of 1h hours are genuine. The
  archive is rejected, no H3 run is made, and 2024 remains closed.

### Changed

- `run.json` accepts an optional `model_timeframes` ladder. The model computes
  only the selected timeframes while the data engine still builds the full data
  ladder; the selected timeframe's model output is unchanged. The SR2 cells
  dropped from minutes to seconds.

### Fixed

- The event-composite strategy accepts registered signal subtypes above 7; it
  previously rejected `signal.vwap_rejection` (subtype 14) even though the
  registry marks it a signal. Diagnostics remain rejected.
- The SR5 absorption count gate now filters on the unique event code 52; the
  first gate also matched `signal.absorption_break` (code 51). The corrected A1
  count is 5 long / 8 short; the underpowered verdict is unchanged.
- The model condition evaluator accepts float `min`/`max` bounds for continuous
  readings such as `rvol_ratio` and `atr`; integer `values` is unchanged.
- The strategy event snapshot selects its event window by binary search over
  the availability-sorted event batch instead of rescanning the full batch on
  every execution bar. The selected events are unchanged; a one-year 1-minute
  cell no longer spends its runtime in a quadratic scan.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-11-07

### Added

- Workflow index, tier runbooks for model research, model change, strategy
  research, and portfolio research, and engineering workflows for requirements,
  release/operations, deprecation, and recordkeeping.
- Workflow and record templates, including the workflow skeleton, policy change,
  data change, release, deprecation, and requirements records.
- Workflow, changelog, and partition checkers, with CI coverage.
- Current improvement run adapter (`tools/improvement/run_current.py`) and the
  `quantrule.improvement-run/v2` manifest.
- Issue templates for task, audit, refactor, research programme, data, policy,
  release, deprecation, and remediation work.
- Workflow lab tutorial.

### Changed

- `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, and `docs/README.md` now describe the current S3
  command surface and point to the workflow index.
- The improvement run contract is `quantrule.improvement-run/v2`; v1 is
  historical.
- `data/partitions.json` uses canonical instrument IDs with aliases for the
  historical research configs.
- The improvement evidence extractor reads the current analytics, portfolio,
  qualification, and model bundles.

### Fixed

- Removed stale pre-S3 status claims from the workflow, architecture, policy, and
  model documentation.
- The improvement run adapter invokes `backtest run`, `qualify`, and
  `analytics evaluate` instead of the retired `backtest` command.

### Removed

- No runtime surface was removed in this change.

## Release rules

- `## [Unreleased]` accumulates entries until a release.
- A released section is `## [<version>] - YYYY-MM-DD`.
- Entries are grouped under `Added`, `Changed`, `Deprecated`, `Removed`,
  `Fixed`, or `Security`.
- One entry per meaningful user-facing or developer-facing change, not one per
  pull request. Internal refactors, test-only changes, CI-only changes, and typo
  fixes do not need an entry.
- A pull request that does not change user-facing or developer-facing behavior
  records "no changelog entry needed" and the reason in its description.
- Released sections are immutable. A correction is a new release or a dated
  addendum in the next release.
- A release tag `vX.Y.Z` has a matching `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` section and a
  release note at `docs/releases/<YYYY-MM-DD>/vX.Y.Z.md`.
- Published tags are immutable. A bad release gets a new tag; a published tag is
  never moved, deleted, or reused.
- The changelog is not a duplicate of the GitHub Project, the AI transparency
  log, or the audit/refactor/improvement records. Each layer answers a different
  question.
