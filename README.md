# QuantRule

A deterministic, rule-based trading signal engine.

QuantRule is a shell application. You start it and write commands — print a candle series, compute an indicator, run a backtest. The shell is the whole interface: there is no graphical interface, no service, and no library to embed.

## Build and run

The workspace uses the Rust version in `Cargo.toml`.

```bash
cargo run -p quantrule-shell
```

The prompt is written to stderr. stdout is reserved for command output, so the same command can be piped or captured.

Non-interactive invocation:

```bash
cargo run -p quantrule-shell -- candles path/to/candles.csv
cargo run -p quantrule-shell -- candles-tolerant path/to/candles.csv
```

## Commands

| Command | Arguments | Output |
|---|---|---|
| `candles` | `<csv-path>` | Up to the last 1000 candles as NDJSON, oldest first |
| `candles-tolerant` | `<csv-path>` | Up to the last 1000 valid candles as NDJSON, plus a quality report on stderr |
| `help` | none | The command reference |
| `quit` | none | Exits with status 0 |

`candles` reads the file one row at a time. A missing file, bad header, malformed row, invalid OHLC, duplicate timestamp, or out-of-order timestamp aborts the command. The shell builds the window before writing, so a late error produces no partial NDJSON.

`candles-tolerant` reads the same file but skips row-level failures: wrong field count, invalid OHLC, non-finite value, bad timestamp, duplicate timestamp, and out-of-order timestamp. A missing file or bad header still aborts. It builds the window first, then writes the retained valid candles as NDJSON to stdout and the quality report to stderr. A run with skipped rows, including a file where every data row is rejected, exits with status 0.

Interactive errors are printed to stderr and keep the session open. Non-interactive errors exit with status 1. A successful non-interactive `candles` run writes nothing to stderr; a successful `candles-tolerant` run writes its quality report to stderr.

### CSV contract

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Header | `Date,Open,High,Low,Close,Volume` |
| Timestamp | `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS+00:00` (UTC) |
| Columns | Exactly six; volume may be empty |
| Order | Strictly increasing timestamps for `candles`; out-of-order rows are skipped by `candles-tolerant` |

A header-only file is a valid empty series and prints nothing. In tolerant mode it reports zero counts.

### NDJSON contract

One candle per line, oldest first:

```json
{"series_index":0,"window_index":0,"datetime":"2025-01-01T00:00:00Z","open":1,"high":2,"low":0.5,"close":1.5,"volume":10}
```

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `series_index` | Stable index assigned by the data engine; survives eviction |
| `window_index` | Position in the printed window; the oldest candle is 0 |
| `datetime` | RFC 3339 UTC timestamp |
| `open`, `high`, `low`, `close` | Candle prices |
| `volume` | Source volume, or `null` when absent; a real zero is `0` |

### Quality report contract

`candles-tolerant` writes a fixed summary line followed by one line per skipped row, in source order:

```text
quality rows_read=8 accepted=2 rejected=6 duplicate=1 out_of_order=1 invalid=4 evicted=0 retained=2
skipped line=3 reason=invalid: high is below low
skipped line=4 reason=invalid: open is not finite
skipped line=5 reason=invalid: invalid timestamp: timestamp has an invalid date
skipped line=6 reason=duplicate: duplicate timestamp at 2025-01-01T00:00:00Z
skipped line=7 reason=out_of_order: timestamp 2024-12-31T23:59:00Z is earlier than 2025-01-01T00:00:00Z
skipped line=8 reason=field_count: expected 6 fields, found 5
```

| Count | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `rows_read` | Data rows after the header, including rejected rows |
| `accepted` | Rows accepted by the window, including candles later evicted |
| `rejected` | Rows skipped; equals `duplicate + out_of_order + invalid` |
| `duplicate` | Rejected rows whose timestamp equals the last accepted timestamp |
| `out_of_order` | Rejected rows earlier than the last accepted timestamp |
| `invalid` | Rejected rows with a wrong field count or an invalid candle |
| `evicted` | Accepted candles no longer retained by the 1000-candle window |
| `retained` | Candles printed in the NDJSON output |

The counts satisfy `rows_read = accepted + rejected` and `accepted = evicted + retained`. A skipped row's `reason` is one of `invalid: ...`, `duplicate: ...`, `out_of_order: ...`, or `field_count: ...`. The report contains no clock value and no unordered iteration, so the same input produces the same bytes.

## Scope

This slice covers local M1 CSV ingestion, both strict and tolerant, and the candle window only. Indicators, higher timeframes, and backtests are not implemented yet.

## Verification

```bash
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test
cargo doc --no-deps
```
